# Mall-Customers-Clustering
Owing a supermarket mall and through membership cards, we have some basic data about our customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income, and spending score. 
For clustering I have used KMeans algorithm and used WCSS to determine the number of clusters with the elbow method. [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kandij/mall-customers)
